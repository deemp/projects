# Developers roadmap

for backend - [src](https://github.com/fullstack-development/developers-roadmap)

## Prerequisites

- See `VSCodium` for `Haskell` [template](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/templates/codium/haskell#readme).
It explains what's available in this project.
- Next, see Haskell [Prerequisites](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/blob/main/README/Haskell.md).
- Following that, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/blob/main/README/Troubleshooting.md).
- Recurse into `Prerequisites` on the linked pages to get even more info.

## Quick start

1. Start a devshell

  ```terminal
  nix develop
  ```

1. (Optionally) Start `VSCodium`:

  ```terminal
  nix run .#writeSettings
  nix run .#codium .
  ```

1. Open a `README.hs` and hover over a function. `Haskell Language Server` should start giving you hints.

#### Handle pattern

- [src](https://www.metalamp.ru/articles/service-handle-pattern)

- Take functions from a **given** environment, e.g. from `ReaderT`

#### Exceptions

- [Safe exception handling](https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/exceptions/)
  - Types of exceptions:
    - `synchronous` - generated in `IO`, thrown inside a single thread. Allow `recovery` and `cleanup`
    - `asynchronous` - generated from outside a thread. Allow `cleanup`, but `no recovery`
    - `impure` - generated in a pure code, thrown when a thunk gets evaluated.
      - Example: `error`

From Haskell in Depth (Chapter 7)

- Avoid using exceptions when possible
- Due to laziness, an exception in an expression doesn't happen until that expression gets evaluated.
- A thread can be killed by other threads or the runtime system (due to memory exhaustion, etc.)
- Types of exceptions:
  - `programmable`
    - used in pure monad stacks (e.g., `ExceptT`)
  - `extensible`
    - Extensions thrown anywhere, caught only in `IO`
    - Supported by the GHC runtime system
    - `imprecise` exceptions - thrown in pure code, order unspecified by the runtime system
    - All exceptions have an instance of `Exception` and are values of the `SomeException` type
- packages - `exceptions`, `safe-exceptions`

#### Concurrency

##### STM

- With `async`, the calling thread isn't blocked when running an **async** action.
- We can check `Async a` for a result or block on it - see [TryAsync](./app/TryAsync.hs)
- `withAsync :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b` - when the function `a -> IO b` returns, `IO a` is killed.
  - There's no contradiction. We can't use the value stored in `a` without calling `wait a`. But this will make the computation `IO b` to suspend until `IO a` finishes or throws an exception.

exAsync = withAsync (threadDelay 3_000_000 >> print "ping") (\a -> wait a >> print "pong")

{- LIMA_DEDENT -}

{-
- `retry` restarts a transaction and blocks the thread until one of the variables that were read changes its value

- `Broadcasting` channel (e.g., `TMChan`)

##### Non-STM

- [Pessimistic and optimistic locking](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/129329/optimistic-vs-pessimistic-locking)

#### Testing

-*HiD, Chapter  8**
Test types:

- `unit` tests -
- `property` tests -
- `golden` tests - check against a reference file contents (`tasty-golden`)

- What is coherence and why is it important to maintain it? What are the possible cases of coherence violation?
  - > A program is coherent if it has exactly one meaning â€” i.e., its semantics is unambiguously determined.
  - `Coherence` is when multiple `type derivations` are possible - [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68008592)
  - For each different derivation a different class instance can be used. This may lead to different behaviors
  - `FlexibleInstances` and `MultiParamTypeClasses` introduce incoherence
  - Need to maintain coherence to write a program whose type checking (`static`) doesn't change its runtime (`dynamic`) properties
- Overlapping
  - How does the instance selection process happen?
    - Find an instance with satisfying `B` of (`instance A => C B where`)
    - Find instance for `A`
  - Is it possible to have overlapping instances?
    - `instance C a` and `instance C Bool`
  - Does having overlapping instances violate coherence?
    - No
  - Basics of Haskell instance selection - [src](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfIlhJFmw3c)
  - Is it possible to have a compiled and working program with coherence violations?
    - Yes - [src](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/instances.html?highlight=overlapping%20instances#instance-signatures-type-signatures-in-instance-declarations) (see example above)
  - How would you solve a problem of overlapping instances in various situations?
    - Make the most specific instance discoverable using the fine-grained per-instance pragmas
    - Rewrite
      - `instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} C a` and `instance C Bool`
      - `instance C a` and `instance {-# OVERLAPPING #-} C Bool`
      - `OVERLAPS` = both
- Orphans
  - What are orphan instances? Why are they undesirable?
    - An orphan instance is a type class instance for class C and type T which is neither defined in the module where C is defined nor in the module where T is defined. - [src](https://wiki.haskell.org/Orphan_instance)
    - Type class instances are special in that they don't have a name and cannot be `imported` explicitly. This also means that they cannot be `excluded` explicitly. All instances defined in a module `A` are imported automatically when importing `A`, or importing any module that imports `A`, directly or indirectly.
    - Orphans may break the functionality planned by the library author
    - Orphans invalidate file fingerprints (hash of a file made by GHC to check later if a file has changed) and transitively - in modules that import them - [src](https://tech.freckle.com/2018/12/12/a-home-for-orphan-instances/#fewer-dirty-fingerprints)
  - How to deliver orphans?
    - Expose type and instance only together by putting orphans into modules and re-exporting them - [src](https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2020/10/29/your-orphans-are-fine.html#private-modules)
      - Cons:
        - a user has to use your instances
        - your lib uses more dependencies
    - Define instances in a separate package - [src](https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2020/10/29/your-orphans-are-fine.html#private-packages)
      - cons: need to track these packages
  - Does having orphan instances violate coherence?
    - When orphans violate coherence:
      - If you actually import both instances, your program will fail to compile.
      - If you do not directly import both, but rather use two modules which independently use the differing instances, you can end up with incoherent behaviour.
  - What are the pros and cons of isolating orphans in special modules?
    - Pros: less often fingerprints invalidation
    - Cons: need to recompile the whole project on changes in that module - [src](https://tech.freckle.com/2018/12/12/a-home-for-orphan-instances/#decrease-the-surplus-compilation)
- How the problem of orphans and overlapping is solved in other languages or by different overloading implementation techniques?
  - Scala
    - An orphan instance in Scala means an instance that exists neither in the type's companion object nor the type class' companion object - [src](https://pjrt.medium.com/orphan-instances-in-scala-322caa78e382)
    - Import packages with type and instance declaration separately
- What are the problems of current typeclasses implementation?
  - There's no formal proof that instance resolution is coherent
- Is there a problem of structuring the hierarchy of standard typeclasses?
  <!-- TODO -->
- What is Final Tagless (FT) style? - [src](https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-tagless-final)
  - Example:
    - `wimble :: (MonadReader Env m, MonadState State m) => m ()`
  - Can extend in two dimensions
      1. a new interpreter (change implementation of `MonadReader`)
      2. a new set of operations (add a constraint like `MonadWriter`)
  - `Application monad` (`AM`) - a monad for organizing effectful application code
    - `FT` can define `AM`
  - `Tagged Initial` - sum types are represented as `(tag, payload)`. `tag` - for pattern-matching
  - `Tagless Initial` - use `GADTs` to ban nonsense expressions, no tags
  - `Final Tagless` - use overloaded functions

- `Functor` laws:

  ```hs
  fmap id = id
  ```

  ```hs
  fmap (f . g)  ==  fmap f . fmap g
  ```

### Type and Data Families

Haskell wiki ([src](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families#What_are_type_families.3F)):

> The concept of a type family comes from type theory. An indexed type family in type theory is a partial function at the type level.
Applying the function to parameters (called type indices) yields a type.
Type families permit a program to compute what data constructors it will operate on,
rather than having them fixed statically (as with simple type systems) or treated as opaque unknowns
(as with parametrically polymorphic types).

> Type families are to vanilla data types what type class methods are to regular functions.
Vanilla polymorphic data types and functions have a single definition, which is used at all type instances.
Classes and type families, on the other hand, have an interface definition and any number of instance definitions.
A type family's interface definition declares its kind and its arity, or the number of type indices it takes.
Instance definitions define the type family over some part of the domain.

- **Type Families: The Definitive Guide** - [src](https://serokell.io/blog/type-families-haskell)
  - `Non-generative` type can be reduced to other types:
    - `Pair a` -> `(a, a)`
    - Non-generative type constructors have arities assigned to them and must be used saturated.

  - `Generative` type constructor - can't be reduced to another type
    - `Maybe Bool ~ Maybe Bool` and nothing else
    - We set the `kind` via a standalone `type ...`. Here, `MaybeIf` requires something of kind `Bool` for construction. Therefore, we supply a promoted `True` to it.

### File IO

- There are several representations of text in `Haskell` - `ByteString`, `Text`, `String`
- `ByteString` can contain both `human-readable` or `binary` data that mustn't be mixed
- Also, there are many `file encodings`. Use `UTF-8` to be safe
- One can encode standard data types into a `ByteString` using [Data.ByteString.Builder](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.11.4.0/docs/Data-ByteString-Builder.html)
- `LBS` reads files in chunks. Can be used for streaming
- `hGet` reads a given number of bytes from a handle
- `stdout` and `stdin` are files
- Can set buffering mode on a handle: `hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering`

### Debugging

- `Debug.Trace`
- `breakpoint` - [src](https://github.com/aaronallen8455/breakpoint)
  - put breakpoints into an app (see [TryBreakpoint](./app/TryBreakpoint.hs))
  - inspect variables visible at a breakpoint
  - freeze other threads (`GHC 9.2.x+`)

### Monoid

- [List comprehension](https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension)
  - Skip elements
    - On a flag

        ```hs
        ["--deepClone" | _deepClone]
