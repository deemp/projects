# Developers roadmap

for backend - [src](https://github.com/fullstack-development/developers-roadmap)

## Prerequisites

* See `VSCodium` for `Haskell` [template](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/templates/codium/haskell#readme).
It explains what's available in this project.
* Next, see Haskell [Prerequisites](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/blob/main/README/Haskell.md).
* Following that, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/blob/main/README/Troubleshooting.md).
* Recurse into `Prerequisites` on the linked pages to get even more info.

## Quick start

1. If you haven't yet started `VSCodium` provided by this flake:

    ```terminal
    nix develop
    write-settings-json
    codium .
    ```

1. Open a `Haskell` file `src/Main.hs` and hover over a function. `Haskell Language Server` should start giving you type info.

* Type class
  * The part before the `=>` is the context, while the part after the `=>` is the head of the instance declaration. - [src](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/instances.html?highlight=overlapping%20instances#instance-declarations-and-resolution)

    ```hs
    instance (assertion1, ..., assertionn) => class type1 ... typem where ...
    ```

* How are type classes implemented in Haskell?
  * What is a dictionary?
    * A data type with class functions as fields
  * How is it defined and passed into functions? - [src](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00844.pdf#subsection.2.1)
    * embed `Superclass` dictionary into `Subclass` dictionary

        ```hs
        data BaseD a = BaseD { base :: a -> Bool }
        data Sub1D a = Sub1D { 
              super1 :: BaseD a
            , sub1 :: a -> Bool 
        }
        ```

    * Passed automatically by the compiler
* Why using constraints on a type variable within a data declaration isn't a good idea?
  * They make code less flexible and disallow some instances - [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40825913)
  * Can be achieved by using `GADTs`
* What is coherence and why is it important to maintain it? What are the possible cases of coherence violation?
  * > A program is coherent if it has exactly one meaning — i.e., its semantics is unambiguously determined.
  * `Coherence` is when multiple `type derivations` are possible - [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68008592)
  * For each different derivation a different class instance can be used. This may lead to different behaviors
  * `FlexibleInstances` and `MultiParamTypeClasses` introduce incoherence
  * Need to maintain coherence to write a program whose type checking (`static`) doesn't change its runtime (`dynamic`) properties
* Overlapping
  * How does the instance selection process happen?
    * Find an instance with satisfying `B` of (`instance A => C B where`)
    * Find instance for `A`
  * Is it possible to have overlapping instances?
    * `instance C a` and `instance C Bool`
  * Does having overlapping instances violate coherence?
    * No
  * Basics of Haskell instance selection - [src](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfIlhJFmw3c)
  * Is it possible to have a compiled and working program with coherence violations?
    * Yes - [src](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/instances.html?highlight=overlapping%20instances#instance-signatures-type-signatures-in-instance-declarations) (see example above)
  * How would you solve a problem of overlapping instances in various situations?
    * Make the most specific instance discoverable using the fine-grained per-instance pragmas
    * Rewrite
      * `instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} C a` and `instance C Bool`
      * `instance C a` and `instance {-# OVERLAPPING #-} C Bool`
      * `OVERLAPS` = both
* Orphans
  * What are orphan instances? Why are they undesirable?
    * An orphan instance is a type class instance for class C and type T which is neither defined in the module where C is defined nor in the module where T is defined. - [src](https://wiki.haskell.org/Orphan_instance)
    * Type class instances are special in that they don't have a name and cannot be `imported` explicitly. This also means that they cannot be `excluded` explicitly. All instances defined in a module `A` are imported automatically when importing `A`, or importing any module that imports `A`, directly or indirectly.
    * Orphans may break the functionality planned by the library author
    * Orphans invalidate file fingerprints (hash of a file made by GHC to check later if a file has changed) and transitively - in modules that import them - [src](https://tech.freckle.com/2018/12/12/a-home-for-orphan-instances/#fewer-dirty-fingerprints)
  * How to deliver orphans?
    * Expose type and instance only together by putting orphans into modules and re-exporting them - [src](https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2020/10/29/your-orphans-are-fine.html#private-modules)
      * Cons:
        * a user has to use your instances
        * your lib uses more dependencies
    * Define instances in a separate package - [src](https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2020/10/29/your-orphans-are-fine.html#private-packages)
      * cons: need to track these packages
  * Does having orphan instances violate coherence?
    * When orphans violate coherence:
      * If you actually import both instances, your program will fail to compile.
      * If you do not directly import both, but rather use two modules which independently use the differing instances, you can end up with incoherent behaviour.
  * What are the pros and cons of isolating orphans in special modules?
    * Pros: less often fingerprints invalidation
    * Cons: need to recompile the whole project on changes in that module - [src](https://tech.freckle.com/2018/12/12/a-home-for-orphan-instances/#decrease-the-surplus-compilation)
* How the problem of orphans and overlapping is solved in other languages or by different overloading implementation techniques?
  * Scala
    * An orphan instance in Scala means an instance that exists neither in the type’s companion object nor the type class’ companion object - [src](https://pjrt.medium.com/orphan-instances-in-scala-322caa78e382)
    * Import packages with type and instance declaration separately
* What are the problems of current typeclasses implementation?
  * There's no formal proof that instance resolution is coherent
* Is there a problem of structuring the hierarchy of standard typeclasses?
  <!-- TODO -->
* What is Final Tagless (FT) style? - [src](https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-tagless-final)
  * Example:
    * `wimble :: (MonadReader Env m, MonadState State m) => m ()`
  * Can extend in two dimensions
      1. a new interpreter (change implementation of `MonadReader`)
      2. a new set of operations (add a constraint like `MonadWriter`)
  * `Application monad` (`AM`) - a monad for organizing effectful application code
    * `FT` can define `AM`
  * `Tagged Initial` - sum types are represented as `(tag, payload)`. `tag` - for pattern-matching
  * `Tagless Initial` - use `GADTs` to ban nonsense expressions, no tags
  * `Final Tagless` - use overloaded functions
