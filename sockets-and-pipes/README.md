# Haskell project with `manager`

## Prerequisites

- See `VSCodium` for `Haskell` [template](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/templates/codium/haskell#readme).
It explains what's available in this project.
- Next, see Haskell [Prerequisites](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/blob/main/README/Haskell.md).
- Following that, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/blob/main/README/Troubleshooting.md).
- Also, read [manager](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/manager#readme) docs.
- Recurse into `Prerequisites` to get even more info.

## Quick start

1. If you haven't yet started `VSCodium` from this flake:

    ```terminal
    nix develop
    # if you haven't yet written 
    # or have already changed the settings
    write-settings-json
    codium .
    ```

1. Open a `Haskell` file `Modules/Chapters/C_1_Handles.hs` and hover over a function. `Haskell Language Server` should start giving you type info.

1. Edit this project. Use `manager`. Open a terminal in VSCodium. Run commands there.

1. What is `manager`? Read carefully its help and its docs (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))

    ```terminal
    manager
    ```
