# Haskell

`VSCodium` with extensions and executables for `Haskell`

## Prerequisites

- [flake.nix](./flake.nix) - extensively commented code
- [Prerequisites](https://github.com/deemp/flakes#prerequisites)
- [Haskell](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/blob/main/README/Haskell.md)
- [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/blob/main/README/Troubleshooting.md) - see in case of problems with VSCodium, etc.

  - `TMVar` - don't forget to put a value inside
  - `stdout` is a shared resource - can put log into a `TVar`

## Quick start

1. Install Nix - see [how](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/blob/main/README/InstallNix.md).

1. In a new terminal, run `VSCodium` from a devshell:

```console
nix flake new my-project -t github:deemp/flakes#codium-haskell
cd my-project
git init && git add . && git commit -m "init"
nix develop
write-settings-json
codium .
```

1. Open a `Haskell` file `app/Main.hs` and hover over a function.

1. Wait until `Haskell Language Server` (`HLS`) starts giving you type info.

## Cabal

**Advantages** - medium setup, can build incrementally

**Disadvantages** - not that reproducible builds

Incremental builds via `cabal` + `Nix`-provided packages. A devshell will run the app via `cabal run`.

```console
nix develop .#cabal
```

## Nix

**Advantages** - medium setup, reproducible build, make a standalone executable from a package.

**Disadvantages** - no incremental builds (rebuilds the whole project from scratch on slight code changes)

`Nix` provides necessary packages, binaries and libraries to the app. A devshell will run the app

```console
nix develop .#nixPackaged
```

## Docker

**Advantages** - medium setup, reproducible lightweight container from a package

**Disadvantage** - no incremental builds

Put an executable into a Docker image and run it:

```console
nix develop .#docker
```

## Cabal + Nix integration

**Advantages** - easy setup, incremental builds

**Disadvantage** - need to start a shell

Make a shell with all deps available and build incrementalllt via `cabal`

```console
nix develop .#cabalShellFor
```

## Stack + Nix integration

**Advantage** - uses stack for incremental builds, very easy setup

**Disadvantage** - doesn't use Nix caches and takes packages from Stackage

### Background

Suppose you'd like `Nix` to supply a `C` library [liblzma](https://tukaani.org/xz/) to `stack` using [this integration](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/nix_integration/).
You'd create a `stack-shell` (more on that below) in `flake.nix` and provide there a `Nix` package `pkgs.lzma`.
Then, `stack` will create an isolated environment, where this library is present, and run your program in this environment.
In such an environment, your program won't have an access to other libraries and programs like `rm` or `git`.
But what if your program needs to call the `rm` command?
In this case, your `stack-shell` should contain the relevant package, `pkgs.coreutils`.
This package will be turned into executables. Then, `rm` and some other commands will become available in that isolated environment.

### Stack guide

This sample `Haskell` project demonstrates `Stack` + `Nix` integration.

It has a Haskell `lzma` package as a dependency (see [package.yaml](./package.yaml)). This package depends on a `C` library `liblzma`.
`Nix` delivers this library as a package `pkgs.lzma` in `stack-shell`.

There's also a `pkgs.hello` package in `stack-shell`.
This allows `someFunc` from `src/Lib.hs` to call the `hello` as a shell command.

```console
nix develop .#stack
```

```console
stack run
```

This `hello` executable will also be available in `ghci` as a shell command:

```console
stack ghci
ghci> :?
...
:!<command> run the shell command <command>
...
ghci> :! hello
Hello, world!
```

Furthermore, as `ghcid` uses a `stack ghci` command, you can run `ghcid` as follows:

```console
ghcid
```

Additionally, `ghcid` will run the code in magic comments (See `app/Main.hs`).

### Setup

Necessary components of `Stack` + `Nix` integration:

- `flake-compat` in `inputs` of `flake.nix`
  - This is to turn `stack-shell` in `flake.nix` into a valid [stack shell](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/nix_integration/#external-c-libraries-through-a-shellnix-file) in `stack.nix`
  - [repo](https://github.com/edolstra/flake-compat)
- Nix [enabled](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/nix_integration/#configuration-options) in `stack.yaml`
- `stack.nix`
  - The file should have the same name as the value of `shell-file` in `stack.yaml`
- `stack-shell` with necessary derivations in `flake.nix`
  - The name `stack-shell` is chosen arbitrarily
  - The name should be the same as the one used in `stack.nix`

### GHC

This template uses `GHC 9.2`. You can switch to `GHC 9.0`:

- If you're not using stack, in `flake.nix`, change `"92"` to `"90"`
- Else in `stack.yaml`, change `resolver` to [lts-19.33](https://www.stackage.org/lts-19.33) or a later one from `stackage`
